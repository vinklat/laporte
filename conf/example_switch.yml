# Example: example of using a binary sensors
#
# - two switches with 20s delay
# - the light works during the activity of at least one switch
#
# you can control the switch by curl (rest api):
#   curl http://localhost:9128/api/metrics/switch1 -d "switch_state=on" -X PUT
#   curl http://localhost:9128/api/metrics/switch1 -d "switch_state=off" -X PUT
#
# watch status via live page
#   http://localhost:9128
