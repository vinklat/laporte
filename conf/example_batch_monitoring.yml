# Example: monitoring state of a batch jobs (backups, ....)
#
# - notify state/changes in your batch script like this:
#
#   curl http://localhost:9128/api/metrics/somejob -d "run_state=on" -X PUT    
#   curl http://localhost:9128/api/metrics/somejob -d "run_state=off" -X PUT    
#   curl http://localhost:9128/api/metrics/somejob -d "success_state=on" -X PUT    
#   curl http://localhost:9128/api/metrics/somejob -d "success_state=off" -X PUT    
#
# - you will always have the actual state of a job in job_state gauge metric
#   state may have one of these 4 states:
#
#  0: job is not running, success is expired (hard alert)
#  1: job is running, success is expired (soft alert)
#  2: job is not running, success is active (OK state)
#  3: job is running, success is active (running OK state)
#
#  watch status via live page
#   http://localhost:9128
